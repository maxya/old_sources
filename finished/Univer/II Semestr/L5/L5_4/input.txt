                Master of Puppets
                (Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton, Hammett)
 End of passion play, crumbling away
 I'm your score of self-destruction
 Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
 Leading on your death s construction
 Taste me you will see
 More is all you need
 You're dedicated to
 How I'm killi ng you 
 Master of Puppets
