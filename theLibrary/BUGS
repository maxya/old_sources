i18n() should add mapping even for untranslated strings and return reference to that mapping.
This should allow constructs like
	LPSTR szFire = i18n("Fire");
Now this is invalid because pointer reference returned is reference to temporary object, so
such constructs should be
	UTEXT utFire = i18n("Fire");
	LPSTR szFire = utFire;
Note that szFire remains valid as long as utFire does.
