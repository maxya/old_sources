NeoEngine is a 3D game engine, designed with platform independence as the main goal, achieved through small core 'drivers' implemeted for each OS/API. Currently supported OSs includes Win32, Linux, and FreeBSD. The MacOS X port is currently unmaintained and, thus, unsupported at the moment.  All platforms provide an OpenGL rendering device, while Win32 additionally provides a DirectX rendering device.
